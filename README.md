Mortal Brigade is a full SFML Game inspired by Lethal Company made in 10 days.
Top View ZQSD gameplay.
Collisions are a bit messy but it's still playable.
Handmade shaders and music for a better horror feeling (we did our best with SMFL).
All the animations were made by myself using Aseprite, and the maps were done on Tiled with the help of Euexia.
